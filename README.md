# Music

This is a repo where I'm using data from bands that I like to demonstrate and practice different techniques for working with data:

  * [acquiring data](https://alisonrane.github.io/emo_exploration)
  * [exploratory analysis and visualization](https://alisonrane.github.io/emo_exploration)
  * predictive modeling (pending)
  * text analysis (pending)
